GwtHighcharts
=============

GWT highcharts wrapper

This project has been created as an alternative to moxie highcharts wrapper [Sourceforge sources](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gwt-highcharts/)  [http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-highcharts/](http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-highcharts/)

Why this wrapper ?

* Moxie wrapper does not seem to be maintained anymore (last commit on August 2013)
* I disagree with some of the design choices in moxie wrapper
* * Mix between view and model that prevent easy mvp implementation
* I want to have a wrapper that can be generated automatically from highcharts [options dump](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/option/dump.json)
*
